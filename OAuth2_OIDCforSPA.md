A single page application is a web application or website that fits on a single web page with the goal of providing a more fluid user experience.  In the past, you have a browser and you have a web server. At the web link is typed, and your browser sends a request to the server to send back the home page of that site, and you click again, and again. You are always getting new pages, and that's why we see a lot of reloading, especially in older websites.
A single page application doesn't do that at all, behind the scenes your browser downloads a little program in JavaScript. Comes down to the browser, the browser saves it starts to run it. It is a complete application. And it usually very fast, you don't even notice it.
The old-age days of the Internet sharing information between services was easy you simply gave your username and password for one service to another so they could log into your account and grab whatever information they wanted, and for sure you should never be required to share your username and password your credentials to another service there's no guarantee than our organization will keep your credential safe or guarantee.
The  standard  OAuth 2.0 is a security standard where you give one application permission to access your data in another application instead of giving them your username and password you can essentially give one app a key that gives them specific permission to access your data or do things on your behalf in another application. The steps to grant permission or consent are often referred to as authorization.
Example an application could support OAuth 2.0 with social networking services such as Facebook or Twitter.
The OIDC is kind of like using an ATM the ATM machine is the client it's job is to access data such
as your bank balance and perform banking transactions such as withdraw money from an account or deposit money into an account your bank card is the token that's issued by the bank it not only gives the ATM access to your account the authorization it also has some basic information about who you are.
The OIDC sits on top of OAuth and cannot work without the underlying OAuth framework. With OIDC there's also a standard way the client can request additional identity information from the authorization server such as your email address using the access token well.
